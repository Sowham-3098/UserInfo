# User Info App

This is a React Native application that fetches and displays user data from an external API. The app allows you to navigate through different user profiles, view user details, and see their associated avatar images. 

## Features

- Fetches and displays user data including ID, username, full name, email, and password.
- Navigation through user profiles with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- Responsive design with a visually appealing color scheme using Tailwind CSS classes.



## How to Run the Application Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Expo CLI installed globally via npm (`npm install -g expo-cli`).
- A compatible device or emulator to run the app.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-information-app.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd user-information-app
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start

### Notes
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection as the app fetches user data from an external API.
- The app is built with React Native and Expo, so ensure your environment is correctly set up to handle these technologies.
- Soon I will add the .apk file to the repository to download the app.
